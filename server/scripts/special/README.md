**Note: These Scripts Could be Dangerous**

Most of these scripts do their work without checking anything. It is expected that you know what you are doing and have done the checking yourself.

- `create-initial-user` - create the `ken.sodemann@gmail.com` user
- `create-initial-password` - create a known password for a user that does not have one, before running `\set myid 1` (or whatever the proper user id is), user must exist and must not already have password, can be used as emergency reset if you delete their existing credentials first

Right now, the only valid use of these scripts is to set up the initial user in a database that has no users.
