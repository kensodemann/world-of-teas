**Note:** The purpose of these "user stories" is NOT to document the whole system or to even be accurate in any way. The purpose of these "user stories" is to simply put into words they way that I _think_ this stuff should work at the time that I write them. They may or may not be actually followed in practice. A better way may be determined during development. The main purpose of these user stores is to:

1. discover what needs to be done
1. determine a generic landscape
1. layout a loose plan and vision
